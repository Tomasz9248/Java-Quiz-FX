# Java-Quiz-FX

During learning JavaSE I did one quick tutorial about JavaFX. It helped me to understand what is MVC pattern and how event handlers work, how to connect view layer with controller. I get to know SceneBuilder when creating UI.

Week or more later I realised that I miss more theoretical tests when trying to solidify knowledge. Most of internet-available has still the same, not much questions and some are event not shuffle. I decided to build quickly simple app that stores questions and answers in database (I found text file in this example  more appropriate) and asks randomly from them. Every correct answer adds point to user score. User is informed wheter he choose correct or wrong by the sound.

It may not be big project but at this time it helped me a lot cause every time I can open it and refresh some stuff. Moreover I am the one who decides what questions are in database so I can update it during my learning path.
